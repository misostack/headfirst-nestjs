### Design

1.Entities

- User
- League
- Club
- Player
- Match
- Game
- Location

2.Model URIs

**Version 1**
- Prefix : v1

**Users**

- Document: /users/{id} /users/member /users/system
- Collection : /users
-

```javascript
GET /users
GET /users/{id}
POST /users
PUT /users/{id}
POST /users/register
POST /users/login
GET|POST /users/logout
```

**Sum up**

1. Login

> Use POST
> return what you need

```json
POST /api/v1/users/login
Content-Type: application/json
Accept : application/json
{"userid" : "admin1", "password" : "pswd"}
// Success
{
    "token_type": "bearer",
    "access_token": "{a JWT token}",
    "expired_in": 3600, // seconds
    "refresh_token": "a random hashed which stored in db",
}

// Error
Status Code : 401 Unauthorised
{
    "code":401,
    "error":"invalid_token",
    "error_description":"The access token provided has expired."
}
```

2. Logout

**From IBM**

- https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWPVP_4.0.0/com.ibm.sklm.doc/reference/ref/ref_ic_rest_service.html
- Login : https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWPVP_4.0.0/com.ibm.sklm.doc/reference/ref/ref_ic_rest_login_service.html
- Logout : https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSWPVP_4.0.0/com.ibm.sklm.doc/reference/ref/ref_ic_rest_logout_service.html

**Log out with JWT?**

- https://medium.com/devgorilla/how-to-log-out-when-using-jwt-a8c7823e8a6

> If we need a strict logout
> The idea is creating a blacklist tokens that has TTL option on documents which would be set to the amount of time left until the token is expired. **Redis** is a good option for this, that will allow fast in memory access to the list. Then in middleware authorized, we can check if the provided token is in **The Blacklist**

**Why need the blacklist tokens?**

- When we need to invalidate all the current user's JWT tokens. Eg: when a user change his/her authentication's identity or password. Or a system need to support strict logout.

3. Refresh Token

## REST API Design Pattern

**URIs**

> - URI = scheme "://" authority "/" path [ "?" query ] [ "#" fragment ] 
> - Forward slash separator (/) must be used to indicate a hierarchical
relationship
> - A trailing forward slash (/) should not be included in URIs
> - Hyphens (-) should be used to improve the readability of URIs
> - Underscores (_) should not be used in URIs
> - Lowercase letters should be preferred in URI paths
> - File extensions should not be included in URIs

**URI Authority Design**

> - **Consistent subdomain names** should be used for your APIs : The top-level domain and first subdomain names (e.g., soccer.restapi.org) of an API
should identify its **service owner**
> - The full domain name of an API should add a sub-
domain named api.Eg: http://api.soccer.restapi.org
> - Consistent subdomain names should be used for your client **developer
portal**. Many REST APIs have an associated website, known as a developer portal, to help on-board new clients with documentation, forums, and self-service provisioning of secure
API access keys. If an API provides a developer portal, by convention it should have a
subdomain labeled developer. Eg : **http://developer.soccer.restapi.org**


**Archtypes**

> - A REST API is composed of four distinct resource archetypes: **document**, **collection**, **store**, and **controller**
> - In order to communicate a **clear and clean** **resource model** to its clients,
a REST API should **align** each resource with **only one** of these arche-
types

1. **Document**

> - A **document**’s state representation typically includes both **fields with values** and
**links to other related resources**.
> - Document type is the **conceptual base archetype** of the other resource archetypes.
> - The three other resource archetypes can be viewed as specializations of
the document archetype.

> A document may have child resources that represent its specific subordinate concepts.
With its ability to bring many different resource types together under a single parent,
a document is a logical candidate for a REST API’s root resource, which is also known
as the docroot. Eg: http://api.blog.ezapi.site

```javascript
http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories/rest-api/posts/headfirst-restapi
http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories/rest-api/posts/headfirst-restapi/comments/1
```

2. **Collection**

> A collection resource is a **server-managed directory of resources**

> Clients may propose new resources to be added to a collection. However, it is up to the collection to choose to create a new resource, or not. A collection resource chooses what it wants to contain and also decides the URIs of each contained resource.

```javascript
http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories
http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories/rest-api/posts
http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories/rest-api/posts/headfirst-restapi/comments
```

3. **Store**

> A store is a **client-managed resource repository**

> A store resource lets an API client put resources in, get them back out, and decide when to delete them

> On their own, stores do not create new resources; therefore a store never generates new URIs. Instead, each stored resource has a URI that was chosen by a client when it was initially put into the store

```javascript
PUT /users/123/favorites/headfirst-restapi
```

4. **Controller**

> A controller resource models a **procedural concept**. Controller resources are like exe-cutable functions, with parameters and return values; inputs and outputs

> REST API relies on controllerresources to perform application-specific actions that cannot be logically mapped to one of the standard methods ( create, retrieve, update and delete, aka CRUD)

> Controller names typically appear as the last segment in a URI path, with no child
resources to follow them in the hierarchy. The example below shows a controller re-
source that allows a client to resend an alert to a user:

```javascript
POST /alerts/245743/resend
```

**Identifier Design with URIs**


> WRML diagram of a URI’s associated resource model

```javavascript
{collection-c}/{store-s}/{document-d}

It means "c" contains "s" which stores "d"
```

**Rules**

- A **singular noun** should be used for **document names**

> /categories/rest-api

- A **plural noun** should be used for **collection names**

> /categories

- A **plural noun** should be used for **store names**

> /artists/bigbang/playlists

- A **verb or verb phrase** should be used for **controller names**

> /users/register
> /categories/123/copy

> - **Variable path segments** may be substituted with **identity-based values**

> /categories/{categoryId}/posts/{postId}/comments/{commentId}

> A REST API’s clients must consider URIs to be the only meaningful
resource identifiers. Although other backend system identifiers (such as
database IDs) may appear in a URI’s path, they are meaningless to client
code. By establishing URIs as the only IDs, a REST API’s backend im-
plementation may evolve over time without impacting its existing
clients.

> - **CRUD function names** should **not be used in URIs**

> For example, this API interaction design is preferred:

```javascript
DELETE /users/1234
```

> The following anti-patterns exemplify **what not to do:**

```javascript
GET /deleteUser?id=1234
GET /deleteUser/1234
DELETE /deleteUser/1234
POST /users/1234/delete
```

> URI Query Design

```javascript
http://api.ezapi.site/users/misostack/send-sms
http://api.ezapi.site/users/misostack/send-sms?text=hello
```

> - **The query component** of a URI may be used to **filter collections or stores**

```javascript
GET /customers
GET /customers?email=leesanghyok
```

> - **The query component** of a URI should be used to **paginate collection or store results**

```javascript
GET /customers?pageSize=25&pageStartIndex=50
```

> - When the complexity of a client’s pagination (or filtering) requirements exceeds the
simple formatting capabilities of the query part, consider designing a special controller
resource that partners with a collection or store

```javascript
GET /customers/search
```


## Design steps

1. Identity Object Model

- Customer
- Employee
- Marketing Campaign
- **Question** and Answer ( answer is value object )
- Discussion
- Comment
- Chat Room
- System user

2. Create Model URIs ( uniform resource identifier )

> HTTP Methods

**GET**

- Retreive the data from a server at a specified resource.

> How to test GET? At a basic level, these things should be validated
> - A valid GET request returns a 200 status code
> - Ensure that a GET request to a specific resource returns the correct data. For example, GET /users returns a list of users.
> - GET is often the default method in HTTP clients, so creating tests for these resources should be simple with any tool you choose.

**POST**

- In web services, POST requests are used to **send data to the API server** to 
**create** a new resource **with-in collection** or **execute controllers**. The data sent to the server is stored in the **request body** of the HTTP Request.
- The data can be JSON, XML, or query parameters and etc ...
- It's worth noting that a **POST** request is **non-idempotent**

> How to test **POST** request? 
> - Create a resource with a **POST** request and ensure a **200** status is returned
> - Next, make a **GET** request for that resource
> - Add tests that ensure **POST** request fail with incorrect or ill-formatted data


```xml
POST /articles HTTP/1.1
<article>
    <title>blue stapler</title>
    <price currency="eur">7.50</price>
</article>

HTTP/1.1 201 Created
Location: /articles/63636
```

**PUT**

- Similar to POST, **PUT** requests are used to send data to the API to **add a new resource to store** or **update a resource**. The difference is that **PUT requests are idempotent**

- When a client needs to replace an existing Resource entirely, they can use PUT.

> How to test **PUT** request? 

> - Repeatedly cally a PUT request always returns the same result 
> - After updating a resource with a PUT request, a GET request for that resource should return the new data
> - PUT requests should fail if invalid data is supplied in the request -- nothing should be updated

**PATCH**

- When clients want to do a partial update, they can use HTTP PATCH.

> How to test **PATCH** request?

> - A successful PATCH request should return a 2xx status code.
> - PATCH requests should fail if invalid data is supplied in the request -- nothing should be updated.

**DELETE**

- The DELETE method is exactly as it sounds: delete the resource at the specified URL. This method is one of the more common in RESTful APIs so it's good to know how it works.

> If a new user is created with a POST request to /users, and it can be retrieved with a GET request to /users/{{userid}}, then making a DELETE request to /users/{{userid}} will completely remove that user.

> How to test **DELETE** request?

> - Create a new user with a POST request to /users
> - With the user id returned from the POST, make a DELETE request to /users/{{userId}}
> - A subsequent GET request to /users/{{userId}} should return a 404 not found status code.
> - Sending a DELETE request to an unknown resource should return a non-200 status code.

**HEAD**

- The HEAD method is almost identical to GET, except without the response body. In other words, if GET /users returns a list of users, then HEAD /users will make the same request but won't get back the list of users.

> It's worth pointing out that not every endpoint that supports GET will support HEAD - it completely depends on the API you're testing.


> Testing an API with HEAD requests

- Making API requests with HEAD methods is actually an effective way of simply verifying that a resource is available. It is good practice to have a test for HEAD requests everywhere you have a test for GET requests (as long as the API supports it)

> - Verify and check HTTP headers returned from a HEAD request
> - Make assertions against the status code of HEAD requests
> - Test requests with various query parametesr to ensure the API responds

> Another useful case for HEAD requests is API smoke testing - make a HEAD request against every API endpoint to ensure they're available.
> Eg : https://rollout.io/blog/add-post-deploy-smoke-tests-to-any-codeship-pipeline/

**OPTIONS**

- Return data describing what other methods and operations the server supports at the given URL

```bash
curl -i -X OPTIONS http://api.blog.ezapi.site/categories
```

> How to test OPTIONS request?

> - Primarily, check the response headers and status code of the request
> - Test endpoints that don't support OPTIONS, and ensure they fail appropriately

> For example, if the DELETE verb is blocked by a firewall, your application can tunnel the verb to the API to ensure that your app can still delete a file.

> But then a lot of frameworks use tunneling to expose REST interfaces via HTML forms, since <form> knows only about GET and POST. My most recent example is a MethodRewriteMiddleware for flask (submitted by the author of the framework): http://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/38/.
